# jQuery_Template_ColorSwatches
I created this simple ready-to-go  template with colorful circles with buttons in order to test out jQuery/JS events. I thought I would share, just in case anyone else could use it. There are currently no events--this is just a template. This implements Bootstrap CSS, but it isn't necessary.
